Arcade Library is a lightweight C library for creating retro 2D games like Flappy Bird or Pong. It supports window management, sprite rendering (color and image-based), animation, collision detection, WAV audio playback, text rendering, and image manipulation. Designed for simplicity, it runs on Windows (Win32) and Linux (X11) with minimal dependencies.

Visit the [Arcade Library website](https://arcade-lib.dev) for examples, tutorials, and full documentation.

## Features

- Window management with `arcade_init`.
- Sprite rendering: color-based, image-based, and animated sprites.
- Keyboard input with continuous and single-press detection.
- AABB collision detection for sprites.
- WAV audio playback with `arcade_play_sound`.
- Text rendering with fixed fonts and blinking effects.
- Image manipulation (flip, rotate).

  - GCC (e.g., MinGW-w64).
  - Libraries: `gdi32`, `winmm` (included with MinGW).
- **Linux**:
  - GCC.
  - Libraries: `libX11`, `libm` (install with `sudo apt install libx11-dev`).
  - `aplay` for audio (install with `sudo apt install alsa-utils`).
- **Both**:
  - STB libraries (included in `include/`).
